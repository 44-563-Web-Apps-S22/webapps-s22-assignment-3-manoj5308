<h4>Algorithm</h4>
<blockquote>
    Sylvester coined the term totient for this function, so it is also referred to as Euler's totient function, the Euler totient, or Euler's totient. ... The cototient of n is defined as n Ï†(n). It counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that have at least one prime factor in common with n.
